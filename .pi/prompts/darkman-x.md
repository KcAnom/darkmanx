description: Switch darkman-x intensity, or turn it off.
argument-hint: "[off|lite|full|ultra|wenyan-lite|wenyan|wenyan-ultra|voice on|voice off]"
---

Set darkman-x mode to `${1:-full}`. If args start with `voice`, treat as voice toggle (`on`/`off`/`status`/`toggle`) for Fish Audio spoken replies (`s2.1-pro-free`, voice `552fdfe0e4f542c1bb381d1006c1ac9b`) — confirm voice state only. If args start with `sfx`, treat as sfx toggle (`on`/`off`/`status`/`toggle`) for personal DMX sound clips (out-of-tree, see `.pi/prompts/darkman-x-sfx.md`) — confirm sfx state only.

Otherwise:
1. Prefer the `/darkman-x` extension command if available (it persists mode for this Pi session).
2. Else load `skills/darkman-x/SKILL.md` (or `.pi/skills/darkman-x/SKILL.md`), apply the requested intensity, and confirm the switch in that same intensity — don't explain the whole rule set back, just confirm the mode.

Args: $@
